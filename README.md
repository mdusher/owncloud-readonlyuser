# readonlyuser

This is an ownCloud app that allows making a user read only by adding them to a group called `readonly-users`.

The app will create the group if it does not exist.

You can install it by adding it to the `apps/` folder with the name `readonlyuser` (rather than owncloud-readonlyuser).
